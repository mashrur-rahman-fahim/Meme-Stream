# Search Functionality Test

## Testing the Improved Friend Request Search

### Backend Improvements Made:

1. **New Optimized Search Endpoint**: `/api/FriendRequest/search-users/{query}`

   - Excludes current user from results
   - Excludes users already connected (friends or pending requests)
   - Only shows verified users
   - Limits results to 20 for performance
   - Minimum query length of 2 characters

2. **Enhanced UserController Search**: `/api/User/{name}`
   - Added query length validation
   - Excludes current user
   - Only shows verified users
   - Limits results to 20
   - Returns clean user objects without sensitive data

### Frontend Improvements Made:

1. **Debounced Search**: 500ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
2. **Auto Search**: Search triggers automatically as you type (after 500ms delay)
3. **Manual Search**: Button and Enter key still work for immediate search
4. **Better Loading States**: Separate loading for search vs other operations
5. **Improved UX**: Better error messages and search tips
6. **Query Validation**: Minimum 2 characters before search

### To Test:

1. **Start the backend**: `dotnet run` in MemeStreamApi folder
2. **Start the frontend**: Run your React app
3. **Login** with a user account
4. **Navigate** to Friend Request page
5. **Go to "Find Friends" tab**
6. **Test search functionality**:
   - Type 1 character: Should show "enter at least 2 characters"
   - Type 2+ characters: Should auto-search after 500ms delay
   - Should see loading indicator during search
   - Results should exclude yourself and existing connections
   - Should show helpful message if no results found

### API Endpoints Available:

- `GET /api/FriendRequest/search-users/{query}` - New optimized search
- `GET /api/User/{name}` - Enhanced general user search
- `POST /api/FriendRequest/send` - Send friend request
- `GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friends` - Get friends list
- `GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friend-requests` - Get pending requests
- `PUT /api/FriendRequest/accept/{id}` - Accept request
- `DELETE /api/FriendRequest/delete/{id}` - Decline request

### Performance Optimizations:

1. **Database Level**:

   - Limited result sets (max 20 users)
   - Efficient queries with proper indexes
   - Only select required fields
   - Filter at database level, not in memory

2. **Frontend Level**:
   - Debounced search prevents API spam
   - Separate loading states for better UX
   - Efficient state management
   - Clear user feedback

### Security Features:

- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- Users can only see verified accounts
- No sensitive data exposed in search results
- Protection against self-requests
