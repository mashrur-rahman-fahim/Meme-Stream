# Meme Detection Feature Implementation

## What was implemented:

### Backend Changes:

1. **Modified PostController.cs**:

   - Added `IMemeDetectionService` dependency injection
   - Modified `CreatePost` method to be async and perform meme detection before creating posts
   - Added new endpoint `POST /api/Post/check-meme` to check if content is a meme
   - If content is detected as a meme, the post creation is blocked

2. **Backend Flow**:
   - User content is analyzed using the existing meme detection algorithm (Gemini AI)
   - If content is NOT detected as a meme, post creation is blocked
   - Only meme content is allowed to be posted

### Frontend Changes:

1. **Modified Post.jsx**:
   - Added meme detection check button
   - Added state management for meme check results
   - Added detailed analysis display (meme probability, humor score, sentiment, etc.)
   - Submit button is only enabled after meme check and if content is not a meme
   - Clear user feedback showing whether content can be posted or not

## How it works:

1. User types content in the post form
2. User clicks "Check for Memes" button
3. Frontend calls `/api/Post/check-meme` endpoint
4. Backend analyzes content using Gemini AI through MemeDetectionService
5. Results are displayed to user:
   - ‚úÖ Content is a meme (can post)
   - ‚ùå Content is not a meme (blocked)
6. User can only submit post if content is detected as a meme
7. Even if user tries to bypass frontend, backend will block non-meme content during post creation

## API Endpoints:

- `POST /api/Post/check-meme` - Check if content is a meme (returns analysis)
- `POST /api/Post/create` - Create post (now includes meme detection validation)

## Features added:

- Real-time meme detection
- Detailed analysis results (probability, humor score, sentiment, keywords, etc.)
- User-friendly interface showing exactly why content is allowed/blocked
- Double protection (frontend check + backend validation)
- Seamless integration with existing post creation flow
- **Meme-only policy**: Only meme content is allowed to be posted

## To test:

1. Make sure GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is set
2. Start the backend API
3. Start the frontend
4. Navigate to the post creation page
5. Try posting regular content vs meme content
6. Observe the meme detection results and post blocking behavior

## Examples of content that should be ALLOWED:

- "That's what she said lol"
- "This is fine üî•üê∂"
- "Big brain time"
- "Stonks üìà"
- Any popular internet memes or meme references

## Examples of content that should be BLOCKED:

- "Had a great day at work today"
- "Looking forward to the weekend"
- "Check out this beautiful sunset"
- Regular personal updates and thoughts (non-meme content)
