# 🤣 MemeStream Points System - Complete Guide

## Overview

The MemeStream Points System (also known as **LaughScore**) is a comprehensive scoring mechanism that measures how funny and engaging users are on the platform. It gamifies the experience by rewarding users for creating content that generates authentic engagement from the community.

## 📊 How Points Are Calculated

### Core Scoring Algorithm

The system awards points based on **unique user interactions** with your memes. Each interaction type has different point values:

| Interaction Type | Points Per Unique User | Description |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Reactions** 😂 | 5 points | Highest value - direct humor indicator |
| **Shares** 🔄 | 3 points | Moderate value - shows content worth sharing |
| **Comments** 💬 | 2 points | Lower value - engagement but not direct humor |

### Key Principles

1. **Unique Users Only**: Only unique users count for each interaction type per post (prevents spam)
2. **All Content Counts**: Every meme you've ever posted contributes to your total score
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Your score updates automatically when people engage with your content
4. **Cumulative Scoring**: Your total score is the sum of points from all your posts

### Example Calculation

If your meme receives:
- 3 unique user reactions = 3 × 5 = **15 points**
- 2 unique user shares = 2 × 3 = **6 points**  
- 4 unique user comments = 4 × 2 = **8 points**

**Total for this meme: 29 points**

## 🏆 Funniness Levels

Your total points determine your comedy ranking:

| Points Range | Level | Emoji | Description |
|--------------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1000+ | Meme Legend | 👑 | You're a comedy genius! |
| 500-999 | Comedy Gold | 🏆 | Your memes are pure gold! |
