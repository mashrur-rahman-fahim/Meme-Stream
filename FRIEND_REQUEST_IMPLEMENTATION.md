# Friend Request Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive friend request system for the MemeStream application with both frontend and backend components.

## Backend Improvements (FriendRequestController.cs)

### Enhanced API Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friend-requests**

   - Now includes sender details (name, email, image, bio)
   - Only returns pending requests
   - Uses Entity Framework Include for better performance

2. **GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friends**

   - Returns bidirectional friendships (user can be sender or receiver)
   - Includes friend details (name, email, image, bio)
   - Shows only accepted friend requests

3. **POST /api/FriendRequest/send**
   - Enhanced validation to prevent duplicate requests
   - Checks for existing friendships in both directions
   - Better error messages

### Key Backend Changes:

- Added `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` using statement for Include functionality
- Enhanced friend request validation logic
- Improved data structure returned to frontend with user details
- Bidirectional friendship support

## Frontend Implementation (FriendRequest.jsx)

### Features Implemented:

1. **Three Tab Navigation:**

   - My Friends: View current friends list
   - Friend Requests: View and manage incoming requests
   - Find Friends: Search and send friend requests

2. **My Friends Tab:**

   - Displays all accepted friends
   - Shows friend details (name, bio, email, profile image)
   - Shows friendship creation date

3. **Friend Requests Tab:**

   - Lists pending incoming friend requests
   - Shows sender details (name, bio, email, profile image)
   - Accept/Decline buttons for each request
   - Request creation date

4. **Find Friends Tab:**
   - Search users by name
   - Display search results with user details
   - Send friend request functionality
   - Prevents sending duplicate requests

### Key Frontend Features:

- State management with React hooks
- Error handling and user feedback
- Loading states
- Responsive message display
- Integration with existing axios utility

## API Endpoints Used:

### Backend Endpoints:

- `POST /api/FriendRequest/send` - Send friend request
- `GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friend-requests` - Get incoming requests
- `PUT /api/FriendRequest/accept/{id}` - Accept friend request
- `DELETE /api/FriendRequest/delete/{id}` - Decline/delete friend request
- `GET /api/FriendRequest/get/friends` - Get friends list
- `GET /api/User/{name}` - Search users by name

### Data Structure:

```json
// Friend Request Response
{
  "id": 1,
  "senderId": 2,
  "senderName": "John Doe",
  "senderEmail": "john@example.com",
  "senderImage": "profile.jpg",
  "senderBio": "Hello there!",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "Pending"
}

// Friends Response
{
  "id": 1,
  "friendId": 2,
  "friendName": "Jane Smith",
  "friendEmail": "jane@example.com",
  "friendImage": "profile2.jpg",
  "friendBio": "Nice to meet you!",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "Accepted"
}
```

## Usage:

1. **Send Friend Request:**

   - Go to "Find Friends" tab
   - Search for users by name
   - Click "Send Friend Request" button

2. **Manage Incoming Requests:**

   - Go to "Friend Requests" tab
   - View pending requests with sender details
   - Click "Accept" or "Decline"

3. **View Friends:**
   - Go to "My Friends" tab
   - See all accepted friendships with details

## Notes:

- All functionality works with JWT authentication
- Prevents self-friend requests
- Handles bidirectional friendships
- Basic HTML structure without CSS styling (as requested)
- Error handling for network issues and server errors
- Real-time updates after actions (accept/decline)

## Testing:

The implementation includes proper error handling and user feedback. You can test by:

1. Running the backend API
2. Using the frontend component in the application
3. Creating multiple users and testing friend requests between them
